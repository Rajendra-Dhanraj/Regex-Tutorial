# Email RegEx Parameters

Welcome to this page that will explain what RegEx is, and how its used with examples. 

RegEx or "Regular Expression," serves the purpose to help you dissect characters from a string. As it searches through the string, it will look for: numbers, letters, white space and special characters. In addition RegEx allows you to search for specific patterns of characters within a string.

RegEx is often used to validate inputs, for example: emails, passwords, phone numbers, postal codes.
